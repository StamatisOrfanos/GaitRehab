    "The first step is to create the dataset for the gait asymmetry and extract meaningful features from raw data. The goal is to create a set of different datasets that will provide a holistic view and different insights that we can use with the aim of creating a model that will provide a real time gait asymmetry detection. The process here includes the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create a new base dataset that includes data in 2 second windows and a 1 second stride.\n",
    "2. Extract simple statistic features from the 2 second signal like max, min and std. The simple statistics proved to be meaningful information for the classification task.\n",
    "3. Extract a set of simple symmetry and asymmetry features from swing and stride times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data provided were designed for classification, since we have only a label for the whole signal as either 'Stroke Patient' or 'Healthy Subject'. In order to create the new real time asymmetry detection model we need to ensure that we have the correct labels. According to [Physio-pedia](https://www.physio-pedia.com/The_Gait_Cycle) the average gait cycle of a healthy adult is [1.2, 1.6] seconds. Taking into consideration the fact that impaired patients tend to have a longer stride we choose to use a 2 second window with a one second stride creating a an overlapping window of 3 seconds. \n"
