# GaitRehab_Models
This project explores multi-modal gait analysis using synchronized data from inertial measurement units (IMUs), Vicon motion capture systems, and electromyography (EMG) sensors. The primary objective is to extract meaningful gait metrics such as stride time, step time, stance/swing phases, enabling the detection of gait abnormalities.
